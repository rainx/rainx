Hi, I am [Jing Xu(RainX)](https://www.rainx.cc/), a life experiencer, a father, a programmer, and someone who wishes to exchange stories with you. I am living in Beijing. 

I have experienced (or be experiencing) the following adventures in my life:

- 🩼 As a primary school student, I started my programming career by using a machine with a 6502 chip and running Basic.
- 🎮 During my university years, I wrote Tetris using Turbo C 2.0.
- 🇾 As a graduate, I joined Yahoo!, which was the largest website in the world at that time (2004).
- 🏪 I worked for Alibaba Group, which is the largest e-commerce website in China.
- 📱 Towards the end of 2010, I left Alibaba Group and joined the boom of the mobile internet industry.
- 📈 I researched and developed a Python project on quantitative trading, which was (once) well-known by many people. (In fact, I intended to learn Python development through this project)
- 🏛️ I joined the startup company RightCapital and continued my career in the Fintech industry.
- ❤️ I got married, welcomed the birth of my daughter, and accompanied her as she grew up.
- 🎵 I was into K-pop culture.
- 📖 I translated a book into Chinese even though my English sucks.
- 🚲 It took 12 days for me to ride from Beijing to Hangzhou, covering a distance of approximately 1400km.
- ♾️ And more in the future,
